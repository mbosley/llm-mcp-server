# LLM MCP Server - Project Roadmap

Last updated: 2025-06-30

## Current Status
Working MCP server providing access to multiple LLM APIs as tools for Claude Code. Recent updates include improved installation guide, cost tracking with accurate pricing, and replacement of Claude Haiku with Gemini Flash/GPT-4.1-mini. Server is functional and ready for use.

## Active Work
- [ ] Review and organize imported TODOs
- [ ] Test integration with Claude Code
- [ ] Verify cost tracking accuracy
- [ ] Document any missing setup steps

## Blocked
None currently

## Upcoming

### v0.2 - Enhanced Model Support
- [ ] Add support for additional LLM providers
- [ ] Implement model-specific optimizations
- [ ] Add configurable rate limiting
- [ ] Improve error handling and retry logic

### v0.3 - Advanced Features
- [ ] Add caching layer for repeated queries
- [ ] Implement streaming responses
- [ ] Add batch processing support
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks

### v0.4 - UI and Management
- [ ] Create web UI for cost monitoring
- [ ] Add usage analytics dashboard
- [ ] Implement API key rotation
- [ ] Add model performance comparisons

## Completed
- [x] Project adopted into claudepm - 2025-06-30
- [x] Initial MCP server implementation
- [x] Complete installation guide in README
- [x] Cost tracking with accurate API pricing
- [x] Replace Claude Haiku with Gemini Flash and GPT-4.1-mini

## Technical Debt
- No automated tests
- Cost tracking uses estimated token counts
- No rate limiting implementation
- Error messages could be more descriptive

## Notes
- Adopted from existing project on 2025-06-30
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables Claude Code to use external tools
- Server provides access to multiple LLM APIs with intelligent routing
- Cost tracking helps users monitor API expenses
- Recent git history shows active development with 4 commits

### Key Architecture
- Python-based MCP server
- Uses mcp library for protocol implementation
- Supports multiple LLM providers (Google, OpenAI)
- Environment-based configuration (.env file)
- Cost tracking with per-model pricing

### Available Tools
1. **analyze_with_gemini** - Large context analysis with Gemini 2.5 Pro
2. **quick_gpt** - Fast responses with GPT-4.1-nano
3. **balanced_llm** - Balanced tasks with Gemini Flash or GPT-4.1-mini
4. **route_to_best_model** - Automatic model selection
5. **check_costs** - Cost tracking and reporting
