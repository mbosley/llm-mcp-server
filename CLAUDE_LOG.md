### 2025-06-30 16:40 - Adopted project into claudepm
Did:
- ANALYZED: Python MCP server project with multiple LLM integrations
- IMPORTED: 0 TODOs from code comments (none found)
- DISCOVERED: Test command: python server.py, Build: ./setup.sh, Run: python server.py
- CREATED: claudepm files based on project analysis
- PRESERVED: Existing README with comprehensive installation guide
- REVIEWED: Git history showing 4 commits with recent active development
Next: Test integration with Claude Code and verify cost tracking
Blocked: None
Notes: This is a functional MCP server that bridges Claude Code with multiple LLM APIs. Recent commits show active development including cost tracking implementation and model updates (replaced Claude Haiku with Gemini Flash/GPT-4.1-mini). The server supports 5 different tools for various use cases from large context analysis to quick completions. No TODOs found, suggesting stable codebase.
