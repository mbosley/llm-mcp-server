### 2025-07-12 15:24 - Added Kimi K2 Basic Primitives
Did:
- Added Kimi K2 cost tracking (estimated ~5x cheaper than Claude/Gemini)
- Implemented Moonshot API client initialization with OpenAI-compatible API
- Created kimi_k2_base tool for raw completions with 1T parameter model
- Created kimi_k2_instruct tool for chat/agentic tasks with 128k context
- Updated README with Kimi K2 features and API key documentation
- Updated .env.example with MOONSHOT_API_KEY
Next: Consider adding Kimi K2 to the route_to_best_model logic for tasks requiring massive context or superior reasoning

### 2025-07-12 15:42 - Created digital twin simulation test
Did:
- Created test_digital_twin.py with comprehensive examples
- Implemented multiple pre-filling techniques (demographic, interview, behavioral, conversation)
- Added consistency testing across multiple runs
- Included multi-turn conversation simulation
- Added base vs instruct model comparison
- Provided realistic persona (Sarah Chen, UX Designer) with interview data
Next: Test the simulation with actual API calls

### 2025-07-12 16:32 - Added Flexible Kimi K2 Chat Tool
Did:
- Created kimi_k2_chat tool that supports multiple use cases:
  - Simple single-turn: just pass 'prompt'
  - With system message: pass 'prompt' + 'system'
  - Full conversation: pass 'messages' array
  - Partial pre-filling: use 'partial_response' to pre-fill assistant's reply
- Supports all Moonshot API features including partial mode for role-playing
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing simple tools
Next: Test the new flexible chat tool with various scenarios

### 2025-07-12 20:13 - Kimi K2 Tool Calling Implementation
Did:
- Researched and integrated Kimi K2 (1T parameter MoE model by Moonshot AI)
- Implemented basic kimi_chat tool with multi-turn conversation support
- Added partial pre-filling for roleplay consistency
- Tested creative writing, reasoning, code generation capabilities
- Implemented CLI-based tool execution framework
- Added dynamic tool generation - tools can be created on-the-fly as JSON
- Implemented safety features: command blacklisting, pattern detection, argument sanitization
- Documented all features in README.md
Next: Consider adding more advanced safety features or tool permission levels

### 2025-07-12 21:06 - Session Management for Kimi Conversations
Did:
- Implemented persistent conversation sessions with auto-timestamping
- Added session_id parameter with keyword-based naming (e.g., 'python-async-debugging')
- Created special commands: @last (continue recent), @list (show all), @clear:id (delete)
- Added return_conversation parameter to get full conversation state
- Fixed @last bug where it was creating new sessions instead of continuing
- Sessions stored in .kimi_sessions/ directory (gitignored)
- Automatic truncation when approaching context limits
- Fixed Python syntax error (false -> False) that prevented MCP server from loading
Next: Consider adding session search, export features, or conversation summaries
